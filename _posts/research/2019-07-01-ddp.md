Parallel manipulators are a class of robots characterised by their closed-loop architec- ture which gives them the advantages of high precision and load carrying capacity over their serial counterparts. Due to the presence of closed kinematic loops, the dynamics model consists of both actuated and passive joints related by sizeable symbolic expres- sions, evaluation of which hinders the speed of computer simulation. As a result, in practice, the dynamics model is often simplified, and control algorithms are used to compensate the model inaccuracies. Further, the computation of a model-based control input in realistic time scales with a precise formulation of the system remains a chal- lenge. Therefore, a dynamics formulation that would enable faster calculations without compromising on the fidelity of the model forms the central idea of the report.
