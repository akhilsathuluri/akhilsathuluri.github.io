This paper presents a method for the real-time simulation of Lagrangian formulation of the dynamics
of parallel manipulators. A choice of generalised coordinates called the extended-configuration-space
is introduced, which builds on the configuration, actuator and task-space coordinates. In particular,
the proposed method presents the versatility to be transformed either into task-space or actuator-
space models without sacrificing on the computational advantage. A comparative numerical study
illustrates the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. Further, simulation studies on a
semi-regular Stewart platform manipulator (SRSPM) and the 6-RSS manipulator are also presented.
